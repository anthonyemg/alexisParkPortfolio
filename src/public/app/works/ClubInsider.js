                <strong>Role:</strong> Interaction design
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The existing UI and the flow of the savings program didn't allow members to directly
                transact on the savings site. We also needed to capture the members' emails and
                associate it with their membership number in order to provide the right information
                and personalized experience via email. We wanted to portray a sense of exclusivity
                by presenting this member-exclusive savings program. Furthermore, the sign-in
                barrier needed to go away in order for users to view the savings, making it more
                accessible for our members.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We worked on different options for presenting this screen and the savings program
                page. We presented options that will be the most intuitive and accessible for the
                members, ensuring that it didn't veer away too much from the existing design and
                feel of the entire site.&nbsp;
