                <strong>Role:</strong> Interaction design, partial UI design
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Club Pickup kiosk was created in order to help the members who place orders
                online and pick it up in the store - pick up their orders even faster. For our
                members, 24 hours in a day is not enough for them - they have family and their
                business to take care of!&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Scenario:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                After the member places an order online, they can come in the store and “check in”
                using the kiosk, letting an associate know that they’ve arrived. The associate is
                alerted, then brings out the order within a few minutes and meets the member at the
                Club Pickup area.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We retrieved data on order sizes, associate and member wait times, and their typical
                behavior when ordering online or shopping in store. We also took into account what
                kiosk device we will be using, and how it would integrate into the mental model of
                our members.
              </p>

                <strong>1st Phase:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                In the beginning, we started out small - the kiosk consisted of a single welcome
                page, confirmation, and error states. Below screens show a sample of the first
                phase.&nbsp;

              <p>
                The home screen was updated to accommodate the scanning ability of the tablet.
                Additional screens and features had to be created to account for multiple orders and
                varying wait times.

                This is an ever-evolving project - we’re constantly finessing the flow and screens
                to make this the most seamless experience for the members possible, and now we’re
                launching it in our Puerto Rico clubs. So far the feedback from members has been
                great! They love that they can pick up their order even faster now, but still get
                the chance to see their favorite Sam’s Club associate.
