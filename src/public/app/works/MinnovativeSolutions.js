                  Minnovative Solutions Site Redesign - Responsive
                </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Problem:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The original minnovative site hadn't been renovated since when
                the company was first founded, a decade prior to this project.
                The business model had changed, and the competitors were coming
                up with more aesthetically pleasing, easily digestible sites. I
                had to design a site that will keep the site looking and feeling
                up-to-date for years to come, while serving the needs of
                potential buyers and providing all the necessary information.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I performed extensive competitive audit of the sites of the
                competitors provided to gauge which information is the most
                imperative to be on the site. After assessing the hierarchy of
                information that needs to be presented in the site, I made a
                rough wireframe or how the information should be presented on a
                desktop browser, and on mobile.
              </p>
