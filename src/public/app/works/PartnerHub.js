                <strong>Partner Hub Redesign</strong>

              <p>
                <strong>Role:</strong>&nbsp;Oversee design direction, Interaction design, UI design
              </p>

                <strong>Objective:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Starbucks partner hub (partner.starbucks.com)&nbsp;is used daily by partners
                (employees) in the HQ building, but most importantly,&nbsp;retail partners
                (in-store) across the country and Canada. It has plethora of information pertaining
                to partner info, pay, benefits, company news, and store resources and alerts.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was launched 7 years ago on Sharepoint platform, and was in a dire need of a
                design uplift. Some work to make it responsive was done a while ago, but many
                functionalities were broken.&nbsp;Aside from the cosmetic needs, the information
                architecture of the whole site was up to many individual contributors, which made it
                very difficult to navigate through. The end goal of the project wasn't only to make
                the site pretty, but to reconstruct the navigational features to surface topics that
                are the most important to our retail partners, and make it as accessible as
                possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Process:</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The starbucks brand team prior to this has provided the partner team with a high
                level design guide for the new partner digital look and feel. The initial ideation
                phase was done by a local agency - I oversaw the process with the partner digital
                product team to see that the design was headed to the right direction, the visual
                elements were in line with what the brand team had initially envisioned, and if the
                interactions of the new feature functionalities made sense. Also, once the ideation
                deliverables were handed off, I worked closely with the engineering team and a team
                of analysts to fill in the gaps.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                The biggest problem with the old design was that retail partners - especially store
                managers and shift managers - who are consistently using the site on a daily basis,
                were having trouble getting to the most important information. For example, they
                were taking several clicks to get to the info they need, or didn't know that certain
                buttons were buttons, and were constantly calling the help desk or neighboring
                stores to find out where the information they needed was.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                I took the feedback that's been taken the most, and also watched and interviewed 10
                different store managers &amp; shift managers on how they go about using the partner
                site.

              One thing that changed significantly throughout the phases is the information
              architecture of partner hub. I conducted some unmoderated, open card sorts, and some
              moderated, closed card sorts with about 30 partners across the country using Userzoom,
              and with 6 partners in person to see how they would go about logically rearranging the
              hierarchy of some pages, and how they would go about re-naming some of the categories
              ("What's 'business acumen'?).

                  In the end, because sbux will be moving platform the site is built on at the end
                  of the fiscal year, we had to park a lot of the new designs as future stories.
                  Some immmediate solves we were able to implement were tackling a few of the
                  biggest issues.

                  • For in-store partners, we surfaced store news and resources first, and surfaced
                  the most-looked up links to the top/above the fold, which decreased the number of
                  calls by 26% upon launch.

                  There are many difficulties I ran into while working on this redesign. In the
                  beginning of the phase, I came up with a lot of &nbsp;ideas that quickly turned
                  out to be very difficult to implement. I had to have many discussions with the
                  development team to fully grasp how the functionalities were originally built. In
                  the end, we discussed how we can improve the current functionalities as much as we
                  can, while also providing a brand uplift. We're currently working on testing the
                  final proposed designs. Constant communication with all cross-functional teams is{' '}
